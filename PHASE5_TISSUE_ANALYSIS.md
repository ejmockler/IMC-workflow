# Phase 5: Tissue-Level Analysis Without Cell Segmentation

## Overview
Phase 5 introduces comprehensive tissue-level analysis methods specifically designed for IMC data where cell boundaries are not resolvable. These methods work directly with pixel-level protein expression to characterize tissue organization, spatial patterns, and regional interactions.

## Implemented Modules

### 1. Superpixel-Based Tissue Parcellation (`src/analysis/superpixel.py`)
- **SLIC Superpixels**: Segments tissue into coherent regions based on expression similarity
- **Adaptive Parcellation**: Hierarchical merging of superpixels respecting expression boundaries
- **Grid Tiles**: Simple regular grid for fast analysis
- **Watershed Segmentation**: Expression gradient-based parcellation
- **QuickShift**: Mode-seeking segmentation for complex patterns

**Key Features:**
- No cell segmentation required
- Adjustable granularity (10-1000 regions)
- Expression-aware boundaries
- Spatial adjacency tracking

### 2. Spatial Texture Analysis (`src/analysis/texture.py`)
- **Haralick Features**: 13 texture descriptors (contrast, homogeneity, entropy, etc.)
- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**: Rotation-invariant texture descriptors
- **Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM)**: Protein co-expression patterns
- **Multi-scale Analysis**: Different window sizes (10μm, 50μm, 100μm)
- **Texture Classification**: Identify tissue regions by texture patterns

**Applications:**
- Quantify tissue heterogeneity
- Detect spatial patterns without segmentation
- Compare texture between conditions
- Identify tissue microdomains

### 3. Pixel-Level Spatial Statistics (`src/analysis/spatial_statistics.py`)
- **Global Moran's I**: Measure overall spatial autocorrelation
- **Geary's C**: Alternative autocorrelation metric
- **Local Moran's I (LISA)**: Identify local clusters and outliers
- **Getis-Ord Gi***: Hot spot and cold spot detection
- **Variogram Analysis**: Spatial dependency modeling
- **Ripley's K Function**: Multi-scale clustering analysis

**Statistical Rigor:**
- P-values via permutation testing
- Multiple comparison correction
- Spatial weights matrices
- Distance-based and k-nearest neighbor approaches

### 4. Region Graph Networks (`src/analysis/region_graph.py`)
- **Graph Construction**: Build networks from superpixels or grid tiles
- **Community Detection**: Identify tissue domains via Louvain/greedy modularity
- **Centrality Analysis**: Find hub regions and key connectors
- **Message Passing**: Simulate protein signaling between regions
- **Flow Matrices**: Model protein diffusion patterns
- **Signaling Paths**: Identify communication routes between regions

**Network Metrics:**
- Modularity score
- Betweenness centrality
- PageRank importance
- Community structure
- Path analysis

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tissue Analysis Pipeline
```python
from src.analysis.spatial import load_roi_data
from src.analysis.superpixel import create_tissue_parcellation
from src.analysis.texture import TextureAnalyzer
from src.analysis.spatial_statistics import SpatialStatistics
from src.analysis.region_graph import analyze_tissue_organization

# Load ROI data
coords, values, protein_names = load_roi_data(roi_file, 'config.json')

# 1. Parcellate tissue into regions
superpixels = create_tissue_parcellation(coords, values, method='slic')
print(f"Created {superpixels.n_segments} tissue regions")

# 2. Analyze texture patterns
texture = TextureAnalyzer().analyze(coords, values)
print(f"Entropy at 50μm scale: {texture[50].statistics['entropy']:.3f}")

# 3. Compute spatial statistics
stats = SpatialStatistics().analyze(coords, values)
print(f"Moran's I: {stats.morans_i:.3f} (p={stats.morans_p:.3f})")

# 4. Build and analyze region graph
graph_result = analyze_tissue_organization(coords, values)
print(f"Detected {graph_result.n_communities} tissue communities")
```

### Hot Spot Detection
```python
from src.analysis.spatial_statistics import identify_spatial_patterns

# Identify hot spots and gradients
patterns = identify_spatial_patterns(coords, values, ['hotspots', 'gradients'])

# Visualize hot spots
hot_pixels = coords[patterns['hotspots'] == 1]
cold_pixels = coords[patterns['hotspots'] == -1]
```

### Multi-Protein Texture Comparison
```python
from src.analysis.texture import MultiProteinTextureAnalyzer

# Analyze all proteins
analyzer = MultiProteinTextureAnalyzer()
all_features = analyzer.analyze_all_proteins(coords, values, protein_names)

# Compare textures between proteins
similarity = analyzer.compute_texture_similarity(
    all_features['CD45'][50],
    all_features['CD11b'][50]
)
print(f"Texture similarity: {similarity:.3f}")
```

## Key Advantages

1. **No Segmentation Required**: Works directly with pixel-level data
2. **Multi-Scale Analysis**: From fine texture (10μm) to tissue regions (200μm)
3. **Statistically Rigorous**: P-values, permutation tests, multiple comparisons
4. **Computationally Efficient**: Superpixels reduce data from 250K pixels to ~500 regions
5. **Biologically Interpretable**: Communities, hot spots, gradients map to tissue biology
6. **Publication Ready**: Methods align with recent IMC literature (OPTIMAL 2024, 3D-IMC)

## Integration with Existing Pipeline

Phase 5 seamlessly integrates with previous phases:
- Uses **validation framework** (Phase 1) for quality assessment
- Compatible with **spatial kernels** (Phase 2) for enhanced features
- Can use **advanced clustering** (Phase 3) on superpixel features
- Included in **benchmarking system** (Phase 4) for method comparison

## Applications

1. **Tumor Microenvironment**: Identify immune infiltration patterns without cell segmentation
2. **Tissue Architecture**: Map functional domains and their interactions
3. **Disease Progression**: Track spatial changes in protein expression
4. **Drug Response**: Quantify tissue-level changes after treatment
5. **Biomarker Discovery**: Find spatially-resolved protein signatures

## Testing

Run comprehensive tests:
```bash
python test_tissue_analysis.py  # Full test suite
python test_tissue_simple.py    # Quick verification
```

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Deep learning for tissue phenotyping (CNNs on pixel data)
- Continuous field analysis (gradient flows, topological data analysis)
- Integration with spatial transcriptomics data
- 3D tissue analysis for volumetric IMC
- Interactive visualization of tissue organization

## Summary

Phase 5 successfully addresses the challenge of analyzing IMC data without cell segmentation by providing comprehensive tissue-level analysis methods. These tools enable researchers to extract meaningful biological insights from pixel-level protein expression data, characterizing spatial patterns, tissue organization, and regional interactions that would be missed by traditional cell-based approaches.
