    "# IMC ROI Analysis Pipeline - Stage 1: Per-ROI Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** This notebook processes individual Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) ROI files (`.txt` format). For each ROI, it performs:\n",
    "1.  Data loading and validation.\n",
    "2.  Optimal Arcsinh cofactor calculation.\n",
    "3.  Per-channel Arcsinh transformation and scaling.\n",
    "4.  Generation of resolution-independent visualizations (Pixel correlation clustermap, Raw vs. Scaled comparison).\n",
    "5.  Iterates through specified Leiden resolutions:\n",
    "    *   Spatial Leiden clustering on pixel data.\n",
    "    *   Calculation of community profiles (average scaled expression per community).\n",
    "    *   Differential expression analysis between adjacent communities (optional).\n",
    "    *   Generation of resolution-dependent visualizations (Community correlation map, UMAP, Co-expression matrix).\n",
    "6.  Saves processed data (scaled pixel results, community profiles, etc.) and visualizations into ROI-specific output directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology:** It utilizes functions imported from the `src.roi_pipeline` modules and leverages `joblib` for parallel processing of ROIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "*   Raw IMC `.txt` files located in the directory specified in `config.yaml` (`paths: data_dir`).\n",
    "*   Configuration settings from `config.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "*   A structured output directory (specified in `config.yaml`, `paths: output_dir`) containing subdirectories for each processed ROI.\n",
    "*   Within each ROI directory:\n",
    "    *   Cofactor information (`cofactors_*.json`).\n",
    "    *   Resolution-independent plots (`pixel_channel_correlation_*.svg`, `spatial_raw_vs_scaled_matrix_*.svg`).\n",
    "    *   Subdirectories for each processed resolution (e.g., `resolution_0_3/`).\n",
    "        *   Community profiles (`community_profiles_scaled_*.csv`).\n",
    "        *   Differential expression results (optional) (`community_diff_profiles_*.csv`, `community_top_channels_*.csv`).\n",
    "        *   UMAP coordinates (optional) (`umap_coords_*.csv`).\n",
    "        *   Final pixel results with community assignments (`pixel_analysis_results_final_*.csv`).\n",
    "        *   Resolution-dependent plots (`community_channel_correlation_*.svg`, `umap_community_scatter_*.svg`, `coexpression_matrix_scaled_vs_avg_*.svg`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:** The outputs generated by this notebook (specifically the `community_profiles_scaled_*.csv` and `pixel_analysis_results_final_*.csv` files) serve as the primary inputs for the **Experiment-Level Analysis Notebook**."
