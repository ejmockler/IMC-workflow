**Last Updated**: 2025-10-23
**Project**: Multi-scale spatial analysis of kidney injury time course
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Cell Type Annotation Working

---

## Executive Summary

### What We Have
- ‚úÖ **Production-grade computational infrastructure** (A- engineering)
- ‚úÖ **25 ROIs successfully processed** across Sham, D1, D3, D7 timepoints
- ‚úÖ **Multi-scale clustering** (10/20/40¬µm) with stability optimization
- ‚úÖ **Cell type annotation engine** (Module 1) - tested and functional
- ‚úÖ **Config-driven design** with comprehensive provenance tracking

### What's Missing
- ‚ùå **Cell type annotations** need threshold calibration (75‚Üí50-60th percentile)
- ‚ùå **Statistical testing** for differential abundance
- ‚ùå **Spatial interaction analysis** (neighborhood enrichment, distance metrics)
- ‚ùå **Temporal trajectory analysis**
- ‚ùå **Biological interpretation** of clustering results
- ‚ùå **Publication-ready figures**

### Critical Statistical Limitation
- **n=2 mice per timepoint** - limits statistical power

## Brutalist Reviewer Feedback (Critical Assessment)

### üî¥ **Critical Issues to Resolve**

#### 1. **Statistical Power (FATAL FLAW)**
> "Your n=2 mice per timepoint is statistically indefensible. I don't care how sophisticated your computational pipeline is‚Äîyou're trying to publish biology, not software."

**Resolution Options**:
- **Option A**: Acquire n=3-5 more mice (4+ months timeline)
- **Option B**: Reframe as methods paper (multi-scale framework innovation)
- **Option C**: Publish as exploratory/pilot with transparent limitations
- **Current Decision**: Proceed with Option C while implementing full analysis

#### 2. **High Zero Fractions (90-95%) Need Explanation**
> "You claim this is 'expected for sparse populations,' but it's more likely poor antibody staining or overly aggressive thresholding."

**Test Results Suggest**:
- Zero fractions are real (sparse immune infiltration in kidney)
- 75th percentile threshold too conservative for zero-inflated IMC data
- Cluster analysis finds populations that gating misses

**Resolution**:
- ‚úÖ Lower global threshold to 50-60th percentile
- ‚è≥ Validate against cluster-based cell type discovery
- ‚è≥ Document threshold selection in methods

#### 3. **Cluster Stability Varies (0.08-0.89)**
> "Some ROIs have essentially random clustering (e.g., D1_M1_01_9 at 0.08). You can't publish unstable clusters‚Äîthat's computational garbage."

**Current Status**:
- Stability tracked and logged for all ROIs
- Low stability ROIs identified in validation_report.json

**Resolution**:
- ‚è≥ Filter out ROIs with stability <0.5 from final analysis
- ‚è≥ Report stability distributions in supplementary materials
- ‚è≥ Investigate why some ROIs have low stability (biological vs technical)

#### 4. **No Batch Correction Despite Batch Structure**
> "No batch correction despite clear batch structure (mouse ID). This will get flagged."

**Resolution**:
- ‚è≥ Test if mouse effects are significant (variance decomposition)
- ‚è≥ If significant: implement quantile normalization across mice
- ‚è≥ If not: document and justify in methods

#### 5. **Missing Biological Analysis**
> "Your pipeline has run validation but produced zero biological insights. You have clustering results but haven't asked any biological questions."

**What Reviewer Expects**:
1. Do you observe neutrophil‚Üímacrophage‚Üífibroblast transitions? ‚è≥
2. Where spatially do these events occur (cortex vs medulla)? ‚è≥
3. What microenvironmental niches emerge during healing? ‚è≥
4. Are there injury-resistant vs injury-prone spatial domains? ‚è≥

**Resolution**: Implement remaining modules (2-5) to answer these questions

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **Module 1: Cell Type Annotation Engine** (COMPLETE)
**Location**: `src/analysis/cell_type_annotation.py`

**Capabilities**:
- Boolean gating with percentile-based thresholds
- Per-marker threshold overrides
- Hierarchical annotation (lineage ‚Üí activation ‚Üí cell type)
- Cluster-to-celltype enrichment mapping
- Confidence scoring for ambiguous assignments
- Parquet/JSON output with full provenance

**Test Results** (3 representative ROIs):
| Timepoint | Assigned | Unassigned | Top Cell Type | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| D1 | 12.5% | 87.5% | Act. Endothelial (11.5%) | Missing neutrophil peak |
| D3 | 6.2% | 93.8% | Act. Endothelial (4.6%) | Lowest assignment rate |
| D7 | 29.2% | 70.8% | Act. Endothelial (13.5%), Resting Endo (11.2%) | Best performance |

**Ambiguity Rates**: 2-8% (acceptable)

**Key Finding**: Cluster annotations identify neutrophil populations that gating misses (validation of threshold issue)

## Implementation Roadmap (Updated)

### **IMMEDIATE** (This Week)

#### 1. Threshold Calibration & Re-annotation
- [ ] Update config: global threshold 75‚Üí60th percentile
- [ ] Validate threshold choice against cluster-based cell typing
- [ ] Test on CD206 (85th percentile override) - too strict?
- [ ] Re-run test_cell_annotation.py
- [ ] Batch annotate all 25 ROIs if results look good

**Expected Outcome**: Neutrophil detection at D1, higher assignment rates

#### 2. Batch Processing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create `batch_annotate_all_rois.py` script
- [ ] Process all ROIs ‚Üí `results/biological_analysis/cell_type_annotations/`
- [ ] Generate summary statistics across timepoints/regions

---

### **Module 2: Differential Abundance Analysis** (Week 1)
**Location**: `src/analysis/differential_abundance.py` (to be created)

**Priority Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement abundance computation (per ROI, normalized by area)
- [ ] Mann-Whitney U tests (n=2 means no t-test)
- [ ] Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, fold change)
- [ ] Stratification by cortex vs medulla
- [ ] Bootstrap confidence intervals

**Biological Questions**:
- Which cell types change significantly over time?
- Do cortex and medulla respond differently?
- What are effect sizes (even if p-values marginal)?

**Critical**: With n=2, focus on effect sizes and consistency, not p-values

---

### **Module 3: Spatial Statistics Engine** (Week 2)
**Location**: `src/analysis/spatial_statistics.py` (to be created)

**Phase 3a: Basic Metrics** (Priority)
- [ ] Moran's I (spatial autocorrelation per cell type)
- [ ] Nearest neighbor distance distributions
- [ ] Clustering coefficient per cell type

**Phase 3b: Advanced Spatial** (Week 3)
- [ ] Neighborhood enrichment analysis (permutation tests)
- [ ] Distance-to-vasculature analysis (CD31+ proximity)
- [ ] Spatial modularity over time

**Biological Hypotheses**:
- H1: Neutrophils (D1) randomly distributed (acute response)
- H2: M2 macrophages (D3/D7) spatially clustered (organized repair)
- H3: Immune cells closer to vasculature at D1 vs D7

---

### **Module 4: Temporal Trajectory Analysis** (Week 3)
**Location**: `src/analysis/temporal_dynamics.py` (to be created)

**Note**: Cross-sectional design (different ROIs per timepoint), NOT longitudinal

**Capabilities**:
- [ ] Abundance trajectories (aggregate across ROIs within timepoint)
- [ ] Spatial organization metrics over time
- [ ] Transition inference (population-level, not single-cell)

**Output**: Cell type frequency plots, spatial organization dynamics

---

### **Module 5: Spatial Niche Identification** (Week 4)
**Location**: `src/analysis/niche_discovery.py` (to be created)

**Approach**:
- [ ] Define neighborhoods (75¬µm radius, cell type composition vectors)
- [ ] Cluster neighborhoods ‚Üí niche labels
- [ ] Characterize niche composition and dynamics

**Biological Questions**:
- Do "pro-repair" niches (M2 mac + endothelial) emerge at D7?
- Are "pro-fibrotic" niches enriched in medulla?

---

### **Module 6: Cluster Annotation Validation** (Week 4)
**Location**: `src/analysis/cluster_annotation.py` (partially in Module 1)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Extract cluster annotation functionality from Module 1
- [ ] Compute confusion matrix: gating vs clustering
- [ ] Concordance metrics
- [ ] Identify discordant populations for investigation

**Purpose**: Validate biological interpretation, debug threshold issues

---

## Threshold Calibration Analysis

### Current Test Results (75th Percentile)

**Day 1 Thresholds** (arcsinh-transformed):
```
CD45: 0.554, CD11b: 1.071, Ly6G: 1.384
CD31: 0.945, CD34: 0.942
CD206: 1.272, CD44: 1.229, CD140b: 0.938
```

**Issues**:
- Only 0.28% neutrophils detected (Ly6G threshold 1.384 too high)
- Cluster analysis finds 3 clusters mapping to neutrophils
- Zero fractions: CD11b 95%, Ly6G 95%, CD206 92%

**Hypothesis**: 75th percentile in 95% zero data = top 5% of pixels

### Proposed Adjustment

**Global**: 75‚Üí60th percentile
**Rationale**: In 90% zero data, 60th percentile ‚âà top 10-15% of pixels (still conservative)

**Per-marker overrides**:
- CD206: 85‚Üí75th (high specificity needed for M2 vs M1)
- Ly6G: 85‚Üí70th (sparse neutrophil signal)

**Validation**: Compare to cluster-based assignments

- [ ] Test alternative: marker-specific percentiles based on zero fractions?
- [ ] Use cluster assignments as ground truth for validation?

### 2. **Publication Target** (Week 2)
After seeing full annotation results:
- [ ] Sufficient biology for pilot study?
- [ ] OR pivot to methods paper?
- [ ] Timeline for acquiring more mice (if pursuing Option A)?

### 3. **Batch Correction** (Week 2)
After differential abundance analysis:
- [ ] Are mouse effects significant?
- [ ] If yes: implement quantile normalization
- [ ] Document decision in methods

### 4. **ROI Filtering** (Week 2)
- [ ] Exclude ROIs with stability <0.5?
- [ ] How to handle ROI D1_M1_01_9 (stability=0.08)?

## Outstanding Questions for Reviewer Response

### Technical
1. **Thresholds**: 60th percentile reasonable? Or use cluster assignments?
2. **Stability filtering**: Hard cutoff at 0.5, or report all with caveat?
3. **Batch correction**: Test first, or assume needed?

### Strategic
4. **Publication target**: Methods vs biology paper?
5. **More mice**: Worth 4-6 month delay for high-impact venue?
6. **Module priority**: Focus on differential abundance (biology) or spatial stats (methods novelty)?

### Biological
7. **Expected D1 neutrophil abundance**: Is 0.28% truly too low, or is kidney injury different?
8. **Zero fractions**: Validate with orthogonal method (IF on same sections)?
9. **Cortex vs medulla**: Should analysis be stratified from the start?
