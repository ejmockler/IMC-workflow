# Technical Limitations - Production IMC Analysis System

## Dataset Characteristics

### Marker Panel
- **9 protein markers**: Typical immune and stromal markers
- **2 DNA markers**: For nuclear identification and morphology
- **Total channels analyzed**: 11

### Typical Experimental Design Supported
- **Cross-sectional studies**: Different subjects at each timepoint
- **Longitudinal studies**: Same subjects tracked over time (if applicable)
- **Biological replicates**: Pipeline scales from small (n=2) to large cohorts
- **ROI sampling**: Multiple regions per subject
- **Pixel resolution**: 1μm standard for IMC

## Critical Technical Limitations

### 1. Statistical Power Considerations
- **Cross-sectional design**: 8 total mice (2 biological replicates × 4 timepoints)
- **Population-level analysis**: Can identify trends across timepoints
- **Limited within-timepoint power**: Only n=2 per specific timepoint
- **Statistical approaches available**:
  - Trend analysis across timepoints (regression, correlation)
  - Effect size calculations with confidence intervals
  - Permutation tests for robustness
  - Bootstrap resampling for variance estimation
- **Cannot track individual progression**: Different mice at each timepoint
- **Hypothesis-generating**: Findings require validation in larger cohorts

### 2. Marker Panel Constraints
With only 9 protein markers:
- **Cannot perform comprehensive cell type identification**
- No epithelial markers for tubule-specific analysis
- Limited immune subset differentiation (no CD4, CD8, etc.)
- No functional state markers (activation, proliferation, etc.)
- Analysis restricted to **marker expression patterns**, not validated cell types

### 3. Ion Count Data Properties
- **Sparse ion count data** with Poisson characteristics
- **Requires arcsinh transformation** before analysis (implemented with optimized cofactors)
- Cannot assume Gaussian distributions for statistical tests
- Background signal varies between channels and spatial locations
- Detection efficiency varies across the tissue field

### 4. Spatial Resolution Limitations
- **1μm pixel resolution** with ~4μm tissue section thickness
- **Z-dimension averaging** across multiple cell layers per pixel
- "Co-localization" indicates **co-abundance in tissue volume**, not direct cellular interaction
- Cannot resolve subcellular localization or membrane vs cytoplasmic signals

### 5. Segmentation and Quantification
- **No membrane markers** available for true single-cell segmentation
- DNA-based segmentation limited to nuclear regions
- **Cannot determine cell boundaries** in dense tissue regions
- Protein quantification represents **local tissue abundance**, not per-cell expression

## Analysis Capabilities and Constraints

### What This System CAN Do
1. **Spatial protein abundance mapping** at 1μm resolution
2. **Multi-scale pattern analysis** (10μm, 20μm, 40μm scales)
3. **Marker co-expression analysis** within tissue regions
4. **Morphology-aware tissue segmentation** using SLIC superpixels
5. **Hypothesis generation** for follow-up studies with larger sample sizes

### What This System CANNOT Do
1. **Statistical significance testing** (insufficient sample size)
2. **Cell type identification** without orthogonal validation
3. **Single-cell quantification** in dense tissue regions
4. **Causal inference** about biological mechanisms
5. **Clinical translation** without validation in larger cohorts

## Configuration-Driven Parameters

All analysis parameters are externalized to `config.json`:
- Spatial scales for analysis: `multiscale_analysis.scales_um`
- Clustering parameters: `ion_count_processing.clustering_params`
- SLIC segmentation: `ion_count_processing.slic_params`
- Validation settings: `validation.n_experiments`

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Requirements
- **~4GB RAM** for typical ROI analysis
- Memory usage scales with ROI size and number of scales analyzed
- Chunked processing implemented for large datasets

### Processing Time
- **~2-5 minutes per ROI** on standard hardware
- Parallel processing across ROIs (configurable: `performance.parallel_processes`)
- Scales linearly with number of ROIs and spatial scales

### Storage Requirements
- **HDF5/Parquet storage** for scalability (JSON fallback available)
- Compressed storage reduces file sizes by ~60%
- Results include full provenance and configuration metadata

## Validation Framework

### Synthetic Data Validation
- **Enhanced noise models**: Poisson statistics, spatial artifacts, isotope interference
- **Cross-validation**: Bootstrap resampling and stability analysis
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Testing robustness to threshold variations

### Required External Validation
For any biological claims, this system **requires**:
1. **Orthogonal methods**: Flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq, qPCR
2. **Independent cohorts**: Replication in larger studies (n≥5 per group)
3. **Functional validation**: Perturbation experiments, histology
4. **Expert review**: Pathologist validation of tissue patterns

## Data Quality Requirements

### Minimum Requirements for Analysis
- **>60% tissue coverage** after background removal
- **>30 nuclear objects** for clustering statistics
- **DNA channel signal-to-noise** >3:1 for segmentation
- **Consistent staining** across ROIs (coefficient of variation <50%)

### Quality Control Metrics
- **Signal saturation**: <1% of pixels at detector ceiling
- **Background uniformity**: Spatial variation <2x median
- **Channel registration**: <1 pixel offset between channels
- **Antibody specificity**: Expected expression patterns in control regions

## Reporting Standards

### Required Disclosures
1. **Sample size limitations**: n=2 biological replicates
2. **Cross-sectional design**: Cannot infer temporal dynamics
3. **Marker panel constraints**: Limited cell type resolution
4. **Analysis scope**: Descriptive patterns only, hypothesis-generating
5. **Validation requirements**: All findings require orthogonal confirmation

### Statistical Reporting
- Report **effect sizes with confidence intervals**, not p-values
- Use **bootstrap methods** for uncertainty quantification
- Apply **multiple testing corrections** where appropriate
- **Document all parameter choices** and sensitivity analyses
