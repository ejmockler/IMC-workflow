# Kidney Injury IMC Analysis - Hypothesis Generation Study

## Study Design

**Objective:** Develop and validate superpixel-based spatial analysis methods for kidney injury IMC data

**Sample Size:** n=2 mice per timepoint (Day 0, 1, 3, 7) - **PILOT STUDY FOR HYPOTHESIS GENERATION**

**Analysis Scale:** Superpixel-based spatial proteomics (not single-cell)

## Methods Focus

### Superpixel Segmentation Approach
- **Method:** SLIC segmentation on DNA1/DNA2 channels
- **Scale Testing:** 10μm (capillary), 75μm (tubular), 200μm (architectural)
- **Validation:** Kidney-specific anatomical and temporal pattern validation

### Key Innovation
Multi-scale superpixel analysis that:
1. Respects tissue morphology (via DNA channel guidance)
2. Captures biologically-relevant spatial scales for kidney
3. Enables hypothesis generation about injury response patterns

## Protein Panel (9 markers)
- **Immune:** CD45 (pan-leukocyte), CD11b (myeloid), Ly6G (neutrophil), CD206 (M2 macrophage)
- **Stromal:** CD140a/b (PDGFR-α/β - fibroblasts)
- **Vascular:** CD31, CD34 (endothelial)
- **Activation:** CD44 (multi-cell activation marker)

## Expected Patterns (Hypotheses to Test)

### Temporal Progression
- **Day 1:** Focal neutrophil infiltration (Ly6G+)
- **Day 3:** Macrophage activation and expansion (CD11b+/CD206+)  
- **Day 7:** Fibroblast activation or resolution (CD140a/b patterns)

### Anatomical Differences
- **Cortex:** Higher vascular density (CD31/CD34), glomerular structures
- **Medulla:** More fibroblast presence (CD140a), different injury patterns

### Scale-Dependent Biology
- **10μm scale:** Cell-cell interactions, immune clustering
- **75μm scale:** Tissue microenvironments, local injury responses
- **200μm scale:** Architectural organization, global tissue patterns

## Statistical Approach

### Honest Limitations
- **No inferential statistics** due to n=2 sample size
- **Descriptive analysis only** - patterns, not statistical significance
- **Effect size estimation** rather than p-value testing
- **Pattern consistency** across mice rather than population inference

### Validation Strategy
1. **Methods comparison:** SLIC vs grid vs other superpixel methods
2. **Scale validation:** Do scales capture expected biological features?
3. **Anatomical validation:** Do patterns match known kidney anatomy?
4. **Temporal consistency:** Are injury patterns consistent with literature?

## Deliverables

### Primary Outputs
1. **Method validation:** Superpixel approach effectiveness for kidney IMC
2. **Scale optimization:** Optimal scales for different biological questions
3. **Pattern identification:** Injury response spatial patterns for hypothesis generation
4. **Technical framework:** Reusable pipeline for larger studies

### Hypothesis Generation
- Spatial patterns of immune infiltration over time
- Scale-dependent organization of injury response
- Anatomical region differences in injury progression
- Candidate biomarkers for injury staging

## Interpretation Guidelines

## Future Study Recommendations

Based on pilot results, design properly powered studies with:
- **Sample size:** n≥8 per group for statistical power
- **Additional markers:** Epithelial, proliferation, death markers
- **Validation cohort:** Independent mouse cohort
- **Technical replicates:** Multiple ROIs per mouse
- **Controls:** Vehicle controls, different injury models

## Technical Specifications

### Computational Approach
- **Language:** Python with scikit-image, scipy, numpy
- **Validation Framework:** Kidney-specific anatomical and temporal validation
- **Scale Configuration:** Experiment-specific, configurable parameters
- **Output:** Superpixel-based spatial proteomics data for hypothesis testing

### Quality Control
- DNA signal quality validation
- Segmentation morphology assessment
- Cross-scale consistency checking
- Anatomical pattern validation
