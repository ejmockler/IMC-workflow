# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS:
"""
To implement golden dataset validation:

1. IDENTIFY EXPERT COLLABORATORS:
   - Partner with IMC domain experts
   - Pathologists familiar with IMC interpretation
   - Clinical researchers with characterized datasets

2. CURATE DATASETS:
   - Start with 3-5 well-characterized samples
   - Ensure expert consensus on expected outcomes
   - Document biological context and clinical relevance

3. DEFINE VALIDATION CRITERIA:
   - Quantitative metrics for biological structures
   - Acceptable ranges for marker expression
   - Spatial organization criteria

4. IMPLEMENT GRADUAL VALIDATION:
   - Start with qualitative assessments
   - Move to quantitative benchmarks
   - Eventually automate validation pipeline

5. ESTABLISH ONGOING VALIDATION:
   - Regular re-validation as pipeline evolves
   - Version control for golden datasets
   - Automated CI/CD integration

EXPECTED TIMELINE: 3-6 months with domain expert collaboration
PRIORITY: HIGH (represents ultimate scientific validation)
